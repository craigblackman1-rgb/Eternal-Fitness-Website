# Work Order: Eternal Fitness — Consolidated 2026-08-27

**Slug:** `wo-ef-consolidated-2026-08-27`
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Owner:** unclaimed (registered from Craig's 2026-08-27 session)
**Apps:** eternal-fitness-website
**Supersedes:** `wo-ef-consolidated-2026-08-20` (open deferred/questions reparented here; that WO's UNITS were already reconciled 2026-08-25, `ec57b88`)
**Scope:** All outstanding Eternal Fitness hub/app work as of 2026-08-27 — the new Outlook-booking attribution problem + label bugs Craig reported today, the unpromoted Lane L work, and every open deferred item inherited from the 2026-08-20 WO. Marketing-site copy items are listed but explicitly parked (Lane F).

---

## DONE (definition)

- [x] "null · Session" labels no longer appear anywhere a session renders (desktop block page, schedule, mobile calendar/Today) — verified live on prod with Emma's and Becky's real rows. **DONE 2026-08-27**, CR-EF-094.
- [ ] A booking arriving via Outlook (Bookings widget or Esther's hand-added entry) is attributed to the client's existing block **sensibly**: date-ordered assignment to the next unbooked planned session where one exists, with a simple designed view/assign/manage surface on desktop AND mobile for the ambiguous cases. Built against an approved Open Design mockup.
- [ ] CR-EF-092/093 (Lane L: bulk templates scoping, ExercisePicker, TrainScreen hydration fix) promoted staging → main, register rows flipped, live-verified.
- [ ] Every inherited deferred item below is either done, re-deferred with a reason, or explicitly killed by Craig.
- [ ] Register hygiene: CR rows for everything here (CR-EF-094/095 added this pass), statuses accurate, `wo` registry updated at each lane close.

## LANES

### Lane A — [AUTO] Session-label bugs (bugs, fast path — no mockup needed)

**CR-EF-094.** Root causes already confirmed in code this session:

1. **"null · Session" pill.** `app/hub/(protected)/clients/[id]/blocks/[blockId]/page.tsx:285` builds `archetypeLabel` as `` `${session.archetype} · ${archetypeName || "Session"}` ``. Outlook-materialized sessions are inserted with `archetype: null` (`lib/outlook-bookings.ts:162`), so the pill renders the literal string "null". Fix: null-safe label — when `archetype` is null, render the session's `focus_label` (which for these rows is already "Outlook booking — {name}") or a plain "Session" pill, never string-interpolate a null. Sweep every other render site that assumes archetype is non-null: `schedule/ScheduleCalendar.tsx` (line ~293 guards with `entry.archetype &&` — OK), `app/hub/m/calendar/page.tsx`, mobile Today, client Training tab, session detail header. Grep for `archetype` interpolations rather than trusting this list.
2. **Emma 24 Aug "view and scheduled" oddity.** Session shows "null.session" in the list but "view / unscheduled(?)" wording inside. Reproduce on prod (client Emma, w/c 24 Aug), determine whether it's the same null-archetype row plus a status-copy mismatch, fix the copy.
3. **VERIFY:** live click-through on prod for Emma's and Becky's rows, desktop + mobile, after deploy. Screenshot evidence in ledger.

### Lane B — [GATE→AUTO] Booking→block-session attribution + manage surface (CR-EF-095)

The core design problem Craig raised 2026-08-27. Current behaviour: `materializeBookingSession()` (`lib/outlook-bookings.ts:139-189`) always **appends** a new content-empty session at `max(session_number)+1`. It never considers that the block may already contain planned sessions (1–4 in Becky's draft block) that have content but no date — so a booking that should *be* session 1's date becomes a stray "session 6" with no content, while sessions 1–4 sit "not yet booked" forever.

**Target model (proposal, for Craig/design to confirm):** a booking matched to a client with an active/draft block should be offered against the block's **next unbooked planned session in session_number order** (date-ordered bookings → session-ordered slots). Auto-attach when unambiguous; a simple assign screen when not. The existing append-a-new-session behaviour remains the fallback when the block has no unbooked sessions left.

Units:
1. **[GATE] Product decisions (queued as `wo ask`, batched):**
   - Auto-attach a booking to the next unbooked planned session, or always human-confirm the pairing? (Auto is consistent with CR-EF-090's "a calendar entry already is a confirmed booking"; but attaching to *content* is a bigger claim than creating an empty one.)
   - What happens on reschedule/cancel in Outlook after attachment?
   - Should the block's "Session N of M · not yet booked" rows offer a "book this" path outward (to Bookings / to a date picker), closing the loop from the other side?
2. **[GATE] Open Design mockup** — desktop + mobile — for the unified view/assign/manage surface. This consolidates: `/hub/schedule/outlook` (Bookings queue), `/hub/schedule/outlook/duplicates`, and the new assign-to-planned-session flow, so there is ONE place to see incoming calendar reality vs. block plans. Brief to reference existing `hub-schedule-outlook.html` / `hub-schedule-outlook-duplicates.html`. No build before mockup approval (no exemptions).
3. **[AUTO once gated] Build** — dispatch to OpenCode lane(s) per DO-SOP-010; `materializeBookingSession()` gains the attach-to-existing-session path; UI per mockup; mobile parity.
4. **[AUTO] Data repair pass** — after the model ships, the already-materialized stray sessions (Becky's "session 6", Emma's, and the other ~112 auto-confirmed from 2026-08-25) need a review: which should be merged onto planned sessions vs. stand alone. Script with dry-run default; destructive merge is a GATE.
5. **VERIFY:** real Bookings event end-to-end on staging (staging Microsoft integration must stay disconnected from Esther's real account — use a test calendar), then prod behind Craig's go-ahead.

### Lane C — [GATE] Lane L promotion + CR-EF-092 decisions

1. **[GATE] Promote staging → main:** CR-EF-092 scoping/bulk-template groundwork, CR-EF-093 ExercisePicker, TrainScreen hydration fix (`claude/merge-lane-l-2026-08-25` merges, already on staging). Diff staging..main first (other sessions' work may ride along — standing rule). Craig's go-ahead required (client-facing).
2. **[GATE] CR-EF-092 open decisions** (already queued as `dmt8rf4wkdn` + wo ask): dedup strategy, auto-name convention (no PII), review-screen-before-commit or not. Needs the live data audit (hash sessions by structure, count natural duplicates) BEFORE Craig decides — run the audit read-only now, present numbers with the ask.
3. **[AUTO] After promotion:** flip register rows 092/093 from "raised — scoped" to reflect reality; verify hydration fix closed `dmt799jrk5j` and resolve it.

### Lane D — [AUTO/mixed] Inherited open items (from wo-ef-consolidated-2026-08-20)

| # | Item | Tag | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Run `scripts/backfill-exercise-uid.mjs` + verify session-transitions logic against prod (and staging DB — migrations run twice) | [AUTO] | `dmszsvmdqdq` |
| D2 | Add Long-Lever Plank + Weighted Plank to `/hub/exercises` — **blocked on Esther's two video URLs** | [BLOCKED] | `dmt8mu6s2da` / `dmsyybn07vc` |
| D3 | Staging: swap off live email credentials / scrub real client data | [GATE] (infra creds) | `dmsm7yawu20` |
| D4 | CR-EF-091 fast-follow: render genuinely-unmatched personal Outlook entries (staff meetings, "LONDON", blank) as plain calendar blocks on `/hub/schedule` + mobile Today — true 1:1 Outlook parity. Fold into Lane B's mockup so it's one design pass. | [AUTO after Lane B mockup] | CR-EF-091 note |
| D5 | Regression check: does a newly auto-created session produce a duplicate Outlook event on next push-sync? (flagged 2026-08-25, never verified) | [AUTO] | handoff 2026-08-25 |
| D6 | `parseClientNameFromSubject` misses `"Online Personal Training - {name}"` pattern (anne wareing case) | [AUTO] | CR-EF-090 note |
| D7 | Orphaned Postgres auth attempts from nonexistent role `dataapp_app` hitting the EF DB — grep n8n/data-app configs | [AUTO] | `dmt6vuahvfv` |
| D8 | Open Design "EF Endurance Block Editor (CR-EF-048)" project visibility check | [AUTO] | `dmt0ix0gewn` |
| D9 | Client portal PWA: reuse staff PWA client-mode screens or own build — revisit now trainer PWA client-mode has shipped | [GATE] | `dmt2qo93nzo` |
| D10 | CR-EF-006 register reconcile (testimonial JSON-LD live on main vs register) — answer already queued | [GATE] | `qmt8mne5c58` |
| D11 | CR-EF-086 (site-wide VI image plates) — Open Design's 2026-08-25 scoping pass (`photo-approval-plates.html`, `image-treatment-plates.html`, `homepage-image-plates.html`) was never reconciled into the register/WO after `wo-ef-consolidated-2026-08-20` was superseded. Needs Craig's scope decision (alt-text only vs. also site-wide visual-treatment rollout vs. split into two CRs) before any build. | [GATE] | see CR-EF-086 |

### Lane E — [AUTO] Hub workout-parity remnants (from workorder-hub-workout-parity-2026-08-19)

1. Training-blocks list (`PlanScheduleTable.tsx`): status-map fix (block vocab incl. Do Not Train), Programme + Progress columns, avatar, Open/Review/Continue action link.
2. Workout-templates deeper parity: detail drawer + assign-from-browser, paste 3-step stepper + success pane + save dialog, start-blank entry, difficulty→Seated/Supported/Standing.
3. Derived Est. duration on session screen (still static "~N min · guide").
4. Styling remnants: back-link labels, avatar initials, cancelled-row dimming, archetype label-map ("Mobility & Movement Quality" everywhere).
   — Check each against current main first; some may have landed via CR-EF-079/Lane L since the 19 Aug audit.

### Lane F — [PARKED] Marketing-site items (listed so they're not lost; no action this WO)

- Blind-fitness/cancer-rehab specialist copy — blocked until host page exists (`dmsiv5xw7ok`).
- Specialist Training catalogue + Blog restructure — deferred post-launch (standing).
- Google Business Profile share link swap in FeaturedReviewedBand (waiting on Craig's link).

## LEDGER

- 2026-08-27: WO created. Root causes for CR-EF-094 (null·Session label) and CR-EF-095 (booking attribution) confirmed in code same session: `blocks/[blockId]/page.tsx:285` + `lib/outlook-bookings.ts:139-189`. CR rows added to register. Open items reparented from `wo-ef-consolidated-2026-08-20`; that WO closed as superseded.
- 2026-08-27 (later): Lane A shipped. Dispatched to OpenCode (`opencode-go/mimo-v2.5`), diff hand-reviewed (not self-report), `tsc` clean. Pushed to `staging`, deployed to `development.eternal-fitness.co.uk`, confirmed. Craig approved production push in chat; merged to `main`, Coolify build confirmed `finished` at commit `f4ac5c7`, `running:healthy`. **Live-verified** via Craig's real hub session (claude-in-chrome): Emma Atkinson Block 2 Session 6 pill now reads "Session", not "null · Session". Hub Testing tab item checked (mobile add-workout item left outstanding — code-reviewed only, not click-tested). Lane A DONE.
- 2026-08-27 (same pass): confirmed Lane B's target bug live on Becky Price's Block 1 — 8 orphaned single-session weeks (24 Aug–25 Oct), each an Outlook booking floating disconnected from "Plan week 1"'s 4 real planned sessions. Also found: Emma's session 6 has real content but a stale "Booked session (no content yet)" coaching-note placeholder — folded into Lane B scope (same root cause, nothing updates the session record after Outlook materialization). Register updated to reflect both findings. Lane B still gated on Craig's 3 `wo ask` decisions + Open Design mockup — not started.
- 2026-08-28: Open Design brief pushed to `ef-control-hub` project. First run failed with a provider quota error (0 artifacts) — retried, succeeded (2 new files, 3 edits, verified real by reading the generated HTML directly rather than trusting the run's self-report). Craig said "yes proceed" / "should be dione" (checked the run's actual status rather than assume) → dispatched the build. OpenCode lane wired the client-profile booking panel (desktop + mobile), the `client_id` API filter, and the settings copy fix. Caught and fixed one real issue on review: dead ambiguous/matched-chip branching copied from the generic queue pattern that could never fire in a client-scoped fetch — removed before shipping. Badge consolidation needed no work (already live). Shipped dev → prod same session (commit `3cf352e`, both Coolify `finished`). Verified live: panel correctly absent on a real client with 0 bookings, API call 200, no console errors, desktop + mobile. Could not verify the populated/confirm/dismiss states live — staging had zero open bookings and setting up a DB tunnel just to seed one synthetic row wasn't worth it; that path relies on code review + reuse of the already-proven confirm/dismiss endpoints. Register updated.
- 2026-08-27 (later still, Craig: "do these now" / "please proceed"): checked the 2 remaining decisions before building blind. Outward "book this" action needed zero work — the existing "Schedule" button on unbooked sessions already writes `scheduled_at` + pushes to Outlook. Reschedule propagation dispatched to OpenCode, reviewed (1 file, matches spec), `tsc` clean, shipped dev→prod (`2bf4108`, both confirmed `finished`). Deliberately declined to build auto-cancellation-on-Outlook-deletion — "absent from scan window" isn't a safe signal, flagged to Craig as needing a real decision + a verify-before-cancel design rather than a guess. `wo answer qmtbg2aasfp` recorded (auto-attach decision, already implied by Craig's approval). Craig raised a new idea mid-session: show each client's unassigned Outlook bookings on their own profile page — agreed it's good, folded into the same Lane B design brief rather than built separately.
- 2026-08-27 (later, Craig: "go ahead and fix these now"): **Lane B core fix shipped, live-verified.** (1) Data repair on Becky Price's Block 1, run directly against prod under DO-SOP-012 — queried live DB first (confirmed zero `set_logs` on all 8 stray sessions, safe to move), count-first (12/8/8), full JSON dump to `D:/apps/infrastructure/db-archives/eternal_fitness/2026-08-27-becky-price-block1-sessions-wo-ef-consolidated-2026-08-27.json`, single transaction merging the 4 earliest-dated real bookings onto sessions 1–4 (preserving prescribed content, adopting only date/status/calendar-event pointers) and renumbering the remaining 4 to close the gap, post-verified against the live DB. (2) Forward-looking code fix dispatched to OpenCode (`opencode-go/mimo-v2.5`), diff hand-reviewed (1 file, `lib/outlook-bookings.ts`, matches spec exactly — no unrelated changes), `tsc` clean: `materializeBookingSession()` now fills the earliest unbooked planned session before falling back to append. Pushed to `staging` → deployed to `development.eternal-fitness.co.uk` (commit `cbe59cf`, confirmed `finished`) → Craig's go-ahead already given, promoted to `main` → deployed to `eternal-fitness.co.uk` production (same commit, confirmed `finished`, 381s build). Scope diff origin/main..origin/staging confirmed clean (1 file) before both pushes. **Not done:** the stale-coaching-note issue and the consolidated view/assign/manage UI surface still need Open Design work (no exemption) — Lane B's UI/design phase has not started. The 3 queued `wo ask` decisions (reschedule/cancel behaviour, outward "book this" action) remain unanswered and still gate that phase.
- 2026-08-29: **Lane E re-checked against current code — mostly already done, audit was stale.** The WO's own instruction ("check each against current main first; some may have landed via CR-EF-079/Lane L since the 19 Aug audit") was correct. Confirmed present today: `PlanScheduleTable.tsx` has the Programme column (l.185), Progress column (l.205), the Do Not Train status pill (l.239) and the Review/Continue action link (l.43-45) — E1's status-map/columns/action items are done. E3 (derived Est. duration) is also done: `TrainScreen.tsx:138` reads `data?.estimated_minutes` with a `sessionDurationMinutes(time_tier)` fallback, so l.1021's "~N min · guide" is derived, not static. **Not re-dispatching a lane for E1/E3.** E2 (workout-templates detail drawer / assign-from-browser / paste stepper) and E4 (styling remnants) still need a proper audit before anyone builds — they were not checked this pass.
- 2026-08-29: **D5 answered at code level — no duplicate is produced, and there are two independent safeguards.** The question ("does a newly auto-created session produce a duplicate Outlook event on next push-sync?", flagged 2026-08-25, never verified) traces cleanly: (1) `materializeBookingSession()` (`lib/outlook-bookings.ts:139-190`) upserts the **originating** `event_id`/`calendar_id` into `session_calendar_events` at the moment it creates the session, so the session is mapped to its source event from birth. Push-sync reads that map up front (`lib/calendar-sync.ts:156`) and branches to `updateEvent` when a mapping exists (l.275); `createEvent` (l.320) is only reachable when there is **no** mapping. (2) Even with the mapping absent, the create path first runs `findDuplicateCandidate()` against same-day events by client name and, on a hit, writes an `outlook_duplicate_candidates` row and **pauses** rather than creating (l.300-315). **Honest limit: this is code-verified, not live-verified** — no query was run against prod to confirm zero actual duplicate events exist today. That check needs the DB tunnel and is the remaining half of D5.
