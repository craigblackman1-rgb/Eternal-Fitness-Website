-- Simple migration: Link existing docs and add display codes

-- 1. Add display_code and client_number columns
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS display_code TEXT;
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS client_number INTEGER;

-- 2. Assign sequential client numbers
WITH numbered AS (
  SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY created_at) as rn
  FROM clients
)
UPDATE clients SET client_number = numbered.rn
FROM numbered WHERE clients.id = numbered.id
AND clients.client_number IS NULL;

-- 3. Generate simple display codes (first letter of each word)
UPDATE clients SET display_code = UPPER(
  LEFT(name, 1) || COALESCE(NULLIF(SPLIT_PART(name, ' ', 2), ''), '')
) WHERE display_code IS NULL;

-- 3. Link existing agreements to clients
UPDATE signed_agreements SET client_id = c.id
FROM clients c WHERE signed_agreements.client_name = c.name
AND signed_agreements.client_id IS NULL;

-- 4. Link existing PAR-Q to clients
UPDATE signed_parq SET client_id = c.id
FROM clients c WHERE signed_parq.full_name = c.name
AND signed_parq.client_id IS NULL;

-- 5. Link existing trackers to clients
UPDATE client_tracker SET client_id = c.id
FROM clients c WHERE client_tracker.client_name = c.name
AND client_tracker.client_id IS NULL;

-- 6. Mark existing signed records
UPDATE signed_agreements SET status = 'signed'
WHERE client_signature_data IS NOT NULL AND status = 'draft';

UPDATE signed_parq SET status = 'signed'
WHERE client_signature_data IS NOT NULL AND status = 'draft';

-- 7. Recreate the view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS client_documents_summary;

CREATE VIEW client_documents_summary AS

  c.client_number,
  c.name as client_name,
