Exercise is clinically recommended for a wide range of conditions including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, COPD, and chronic pain. The key is having a qualified specialist who understands your specific condition and can programme safely around it. As a Level 4 qualified Exercise Referral Specialist, I am trained to work with all of these."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. A GP referral is welcome but not required. Many clients come independently with a health condition they want to manage or improve through exercise. I will ask about your medical history at your first session and may request that you check with your GP if there are any specific contraindications to address first."

If your condition is not listed, please get in touch — the answer is almost always yes."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The fundamentals of exercise are the same, but the approach must account for how your condition affects your body — including fatigue patterns, medications, contraindicated movements, and day-to-day variability. A standard Level 3 PT is not trained for this. As a Level 4 specialist, I programme around your condition rather than despite it."
