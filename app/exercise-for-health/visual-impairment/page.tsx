        "text": "Yes. Personal training for visually impaired people (VIPs) is very achievable with the right approach. Sessions rely on clear verbal instruction, tactile guidance where appropriate, consistent equipment placement, and a stable, familiar environment. The private studio format at Eternal Fitness is ideal — there are no other people to navigate around, and the layout stays consistent so you can build confidence with the space."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "I use clear, detailed verbal instruction rather than visual demonstration. Equipment is always placed in the same position so you know where to expect it. I use tactile guidance to help with movement positioning when that is welcome. And sessions are structured with extra time to build familiarity with movements and the environment. The goal is for you to feel confident and safe from the very first session."
