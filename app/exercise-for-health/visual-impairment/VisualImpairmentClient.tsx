                Most personal training relies heavily on visual demonstration — watch me, do what I do. That does not
                work for VIP clients, and attempting it is both ineffective and exclusionary.
              </p>
              <p className="ds-body" style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                My approach for visually impaired clients is built around precise verbal instruction, proprioceptive
                awareness, and a consistent, predictable environment. You learn to feel the movement correctly rather
                than see it — which, for many people, produces a more mindful and connected training experience anyway.

              <p className="ds-body" style={{ marginBottom: 28 }}>
                The private studio format is particularly suited to VIP training — no crowds, no unexpected movement,
                no pressure to navigate a busy gym floor. Just you, me, and a focused session.
