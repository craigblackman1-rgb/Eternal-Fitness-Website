    title: "Is exercise safe if I have osteoporosis?",

  {
    title: "What exercises should I avoid with osteoporosis?",
    body: "High-impact activities, uncontrolled twisting of the spine, heavy forward flexion (bending at the waist to touch your toes), and exercises that place excessive load through a fracture-prone area all need careful consideration. I assess your individual risk profile and programme around it.",

  {
    title: "How quickly can exercise improve bone density?",
    body: "Bone adaptation is slower than muscle adaptation — measurable changes on a DEXA scan typically take 6–12 months of consistent training.

                Bone is living tissue. It adapts and strengthens when loaded appropriately — just like muscle.
                This is why weight-bearing and resistance exercise is the single most effective
                non-pharmacological intervention for bone density.
              </p>
              <p className="ds-body" style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                But when you have osteoporosis, the margin for error is narrow. Too little loading will not
                stimulate bone adaptation. Too much — or the wrong type of loading — can increase fracture
                risk. Getting it right requires knowing exactly what your skeleton can tolerate and how to
                progress it safely.
