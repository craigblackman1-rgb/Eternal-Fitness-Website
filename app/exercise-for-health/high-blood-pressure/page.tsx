        "text": "Yes — in most cases, exercise is both safe and clinically recommended for managing high blood pressure. The key is having a qualified specialist who understands when it is safe to exercise, how to monitor your response, and what to avoid. As a Level 4 Exercise Referral Specialist, I am trained to programme safely for hypertension, including contraindicated movements and intensity management."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Both aerobic exercise and resistance training have been shown to lower blood pressure. Moderate-intensity steady-state cardio, circuit-style resistance work, and controlled rhythmic movements all contribute. I programme a balanced approach that combines these elements while monitoring your response throughout every session."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. A GP referral is welcome but not required. Many clients come independently with a hypertension diagnosis they want to manage through exercise. I will ask about your medical history, current medications, and any contraindications at your first session. If there are specific concerns, I may recommend checking with your GP before we start."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "I take your blood pressure before every session to establish a baseline. During exercise I use a combination of heart rate monitoring and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) — how hard you feel you are working on a scale — rather than relying solely on heart rate, because some blood pressure medications can alter your heart rate response."
