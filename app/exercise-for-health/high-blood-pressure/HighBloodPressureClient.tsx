                NICE guidelines and NHS exercise referral schemes consistently show that regular, moderate
                exercise can reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In some cases, the effect is
                comparable to a single antihypertensive medication.
              </p>
              <p className="ds-body" style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
                But doing it safely requires understanding when blood pressure is too high to exercise,
                how different medications affect heart rate and exercise response, what movements can cause
                dangerous pressure spikes, and how to progress without risking a hypertensive response.

                This is where Level 4 training matters. Standard personal trainers (Level 3) are not
                equipped to make these clinical judgments. I am.
