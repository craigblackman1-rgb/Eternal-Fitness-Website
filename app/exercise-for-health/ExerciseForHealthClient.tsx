                Think of it like seeing a physiotherapist rather than a personal trainer. The goal is not weight loss,
                not aesthetics, and not performance. The goal is health — managing your condition, building functional
                strength, improving quality of life.

                I work the same way a physio or an osteopath does — targeting conditions, not demographics. Every session
                starts with a check-in. The plan for that day is set then, based on how you actually feel — not how you
                felt last week.
