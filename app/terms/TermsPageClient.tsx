        </LegalNote>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="booking-and-availability" n={3} title="Booking and availability">
        <ol>
          <li>Free consultations are booked through our online booking calendar (Microsoft Bookings); ongoing session slots are then arranged directly with Esther.</li>
          <li>Sessions must be booked in advance and confirmed by Esther.</li>
          <li>Booking confirmations are provided by email or message.</li>
          <li>Availability is discussed and agreed at the point of consultation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We may occasionally need to adjust schedules due to unforeseen circumstances and will always aim to provide as much notice as possible.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="health-safety" n={4} title="Health, safety, and your responsibility">
        <p>To keep training safe and appropriate for you:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You agree to provide accurate and up-to-date information about your health, injuries, symptoms, medications, and any changes to your condition.</li>
          <li>You agree to follow Esther&apos;s guidance during sessions and use equipment responsibly.</li>
          <li>If anything feels painful, unsafe, or unusual, you must stop and tell Esther immediately.</li>
          <li>You understand that Esther may ask you to complete a health questionnaire (PAR-Q) before your first session.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If Esther believes training is not currently safe for you, she may pause or decline to continue services until appropriate medical clearance is provided. This is done with your wellbeing in mind.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="payments" n={5} title="Payments">
        <p>Payment terms — including whether sessions are billed individually, in packages, or on an ongoing basis — are confirmed at booking or following your initial consultation. Prices are quoted in GBP (&pound;). Payments must be made by the agreed due date. Late payment may result in pausing future bookings until the balance is cleared.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="cancellations" n={6} title="Cancellations, rescheduling, and missed sessions">
        <p>We understand plans change and aim to be fair and consistent in how we handle this.</p>
        <h3>Client cancellations and rescheduling</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If you cancel or reschedule with at least 24 hours&apos; notice, your session can be moved to a new time subject to availability.</li>
          <li>If you cancel or reschedule with less than 24 hours&apos; notice, the session may be charged in full.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>No-shows</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If you do not attend your session without contacting us, it will be treated as a no-show and charged in full.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Late arrival</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If you arrive late, your session may still end at the scheduled time. The full session fee applies.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cancellations by Eternal Fitness</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If Esther needs to cancel due to illness, emergency, or unavoidable circumstances, you can choose to reschedule or receive a full refund for that session.</li>
        </ol>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="cooling-off" n={7} title="Your right to cancel (14-day cooling-off period)">
        <p>If you book and pay for a package of sessions online or over the phone (a "distance contract" under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013), you have a legal right to cancel within 14 days of that booking, for any reason, and receive a full refund — this is separate from, and in addition to, the session-by-session cancellation policy above.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To cancel under this right, just tell us clearly — by email, message, or phone — that you want to cancel. You don't need a reason.</li>
          <li>If no sessions have started yet, you'll get a full refund.</li>
          <li>If you'd like training to begin before the 14 days are up, we'll ask you to confirm that in writing first. In that case, if you then cancel partway through the 14 days, you'll be refunded for the unused sessions, minus a fair amount for whatever's already been delivered.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This 14-day right doesn't apply to a booking made in person at the studio, or once a package of sessions has been fully completed.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="packages" n={8} title="Packages and expiry">
        <p>If you purchase a package of sessions: packages are personal to you and cannot be transferred to another person unless agreed in writing. Any expiry period will be communicated at the point of purchase. Refunds on partially used packages are handled on a case-by-case basis and may be subject to an administration fee, except where consumer law requires otherwise.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="results" n={9} title="Results and expectations">
        <p>Esther provides professional coaching, structure, and support. However:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Results vary from person to person based on consistency, health history, lifestyle, and many other factors.</li>
          <li>We cannot guarantee specific outcomes.</li>
          <li>Our focus is sustainable, long-term progress — not quick fixes or short-term transformations.</li>
        </ol>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="studio-rules" n={10} title="Studio rules and conduct">
        <p>To maintain a calm and safe environment for all clients: please be respectful of Esther, the studio space, and any other clients you may encounter. Follow safety guidance and studio instructions at all times. Use clean indoor footwear if requested. Abusive, threatening, or inappropriate behaviour will result in the immediate end of a session, and future bookings may be refused at Esther&apos;s discretion.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="liability" n={11} title="Liability and assumption of risk">
        <ol>
          <li>Exercise involves inherent risk. By choosing to train, you acknowledge that physical activity may carry a risk of injury.</li>
          <li>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Eternal Fitness is not liable for loss, damage, or injury resulting from: inaccurate or withheld information provided by you, failure to follow instructions, or misuse of equipment.</li>
          <li>Nothing in these Terms limits liability where it would be unlawful to do so — including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or fraudulent misrepresentation.</li>
        </ol>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="complaints" n={12} title="Complaints">
        <p>If something's not right, please tell Esther directly first at <a href="mailto:esther.fair@eternal-fitness.co.uk">esther.fair@eternal-fitness.co.uk</a> — most things can be sorted out quickly with a conversation.
