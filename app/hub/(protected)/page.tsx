/* ── S5 Today (design-systems v3/03-today.html) ───────────────────────────
   Booked sessions, then outstanding tasks, then alerts — each alert linking
   to the thing you do about it.

   Replaces the previous dashboard's seven browse widgets (recent clients,
   recent blocks, this week's plan, recent check-ins, active blocks…). Those
   answered "what has been happening"; this surface answers "what needs me",
   so dropping them is the design rather than an omission.

   ONE exception, kept deliberately: "updates due". The old dashboard
   surfaced clients approaching or past their next update deadline, and
   nothing else in the hub chases that — dropping it would quietly stop
   updates going out. It survives as an alert row, which is the shape this
   screen uses for exactly this kind of thing. */

/* This page reads the database on every request and must never be
   statically prerendered: the Docker build has no database, so Next trying to
   generate it at build time fails the build outright. The other hub pages get
   this implicitly by calling createClient() (which reads cookies); this one
   only uses the pool, so it has to say so. */
