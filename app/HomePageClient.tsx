        <p>Esther stands at the kettlebell shelves with a hand resting on the bells along the top row, turned back towards the camera. The bells sit in weight order, the lighter ones marked with coloured bands. Along the wall behind her are the mirror, the whiteboard, the suspension straps and the adjustable bench, each in its own fixed place; the floor between them is clear.</p>
