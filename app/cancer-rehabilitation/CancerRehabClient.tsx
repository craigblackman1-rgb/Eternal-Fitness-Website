"Chemotherapy and radiotherapy significantly affect energy, immune function, and physical capacity — and those effects are unpredictable from week to week. Sessions during active treatment are lower intensity, shorter, and built around your current treatment schedule. Every session begins with a check-in." },
    { title: content?.stage_2_title ?? "In remission", body: content?.stage_2_body ?? "Remission brings its own challenges — rebuilding fitness that has been lost, managing ongoing fatigue or side effects, and navigating the physical and emotional after-effects of treatment. Sessions progress gradually, respecting the timeline your body needs." },
    { title: content?.stage_3_title ?? "Post-surgery", body: content?.stage_3_body ??

It is physiologically distinct — and training must account for it. I will never push through CRF or interpret it as effort avoidance." },
    { title: content?.cons_2_title ?? "Lymphoedema awareness", body: content?.cons_2_body ?? "For clients with or at risk of lymphoedema, I monitor for signs of swelling, avoid tight compression, and follow safe exercise guidelines. Exercise can actually help manage lymphoedema when programmed correctly." },
    { title: content?.cons_3_title ?? "Bone density", body: content?.cons_3_body ?? "Some cancer treatments (particularly certain hormonal therapies) accelerate bone density loss. Weight-bearing and resistance exercise is clinically recommended — but load and progression must be managed carefully." },
    { title: content?.cons_4_title ?? "GP or oncologist sign-off", body: content?.cons_4_body ??

The programme must account for your specific treatment, side effects, and current capacity. I will always ask for GP or oncologist sign-off before beginning." },
    { title: content?.faq_2_title ?? "What is cancer-related fatigue and how do you account for it?", body: content?.faq_2_body ?? "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is physiologically different from ordinary tiredness — it does not improve with rest in the same way. I am trained to recognise CRF and programme around it. Sessions may be shorter or lower in intensity on harder days. That is not failure — it is appropriate clinical management." },
    { title: content?.faq_3_title ?? "When can I start exercising after surgery?", body: content?.faq_3_body ?? "This depends entirely on the type of surgery and your recovery. I work with the guidance of your surgical team and will not progress any movement without appropriate medical clearance." },

I work with people during active chemotherapy or radiotherapy, people in remission, and those who have finished treatment but are rebuilding. Each stage requires a different approach — the programme is built around where you are right now." },
